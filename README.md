Xanny is a _simple_, _fast_ and _low_ **HTTP** router and **URL** marcher for building **Deno** servers. If you need performance and good productivity, you will love it.

### Features

- Developer friendly, very expressive and help the developer in their daily use, without sacrificing performance and security.
- Lightweight and modular design allows for a flexible framework.
- Focus on high performance.
- Middleware support, incoming HTTP request can be handled by a chain of middlewares and the final action.
- Excellent and fluent documentation.

## Getting Started

Let's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:

```ts
const app = new Application();

const r = app.NewRoute({ maxRoutes:2 });

r.WithMethods(RequestMethod.GET)
    .Path("/hello")
    .HandleFunc(function (Request: HttpRequest, ResponseWriter: HttpResponse) {
      ResponseWriter.WithBody("Hello Xanny").Return();
    })
    .Path("/demo")
    .HandleFunc(function (Request: HttpRequest, ResponseWriter: HttpResponse) {
      ResponseWriter.WithBody("Hello Xanny Demo").Return();
    });

app.ListenAndServe({ port: 8080 });
```

Here we register two routes mapping URL path to handler. if an incoming request URL matches one of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passingWe believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling
(`HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse`) as parameters.

Benchmarks taken using [https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks](https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks). This is a synthetic, `hello world` benchmark that aims to evaluate the framework overhead. The overhead that each framework has on your application depends on your application, you should **always** benchmark if performance matters to you.
